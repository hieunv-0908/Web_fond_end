        Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical
        songwriting and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as Swifties.
        
        Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006),
        "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Our Song" and "You Belong with Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats.
        She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and explored pop on the synth-pop 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny
        inspired the hip-hop-influenced Reputation (2017). The album topped the US Billboard 200, with its singles including
        "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".</i>  </p>
