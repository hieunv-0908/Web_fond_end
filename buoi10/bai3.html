            <h2>5 things to know about artoria pendragon</h2>
            <p>
                - The legend originates from the fact that Uther Pendragon (the current king of the United Kingdom) fell
                deeply in love
                with Igrayne (wife of Duke Gorlois of Cornwall) but was rejected by her because he feared it would
                interfere with the
                affairs of the two countries. Being rejected caused Uther to fall ill and had to summon Merlin (a
                magician born to a
                woman and an Incubus) to cure him. Merlin helped Uther transform into Gorlois (Igrayne's husband) so
                that Uther could
                have sex with the woman of his dreams. Some time later, Igrayne became pregnant and gave birth to Arthur
                Pendragon. But
                fearing that it would cause feud between the two kingdoms, Uther ordered Merlin to give the baby to
                Ector and his wife
                to take care of.
